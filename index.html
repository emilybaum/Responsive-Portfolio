                    <p>Hi there! Some things you should know about me are that I love to <strong>travel the world</strong> (always taking recommendations), am a <strong>DIY project aficionado</strong>, am obsessed with <strong>IKEA</strong> (so much), have spent a few years playing <strong>competitive dodgeball</strong>, genuinely love <strong>helping people</strong>, find myself <strong>always learning something</strong> about something, enjoy <strong>good documentaries</strong> over many movies, work at <strong>LinkedIn</strong> (love it), and I am insanely <strong>curious about how stuff works</strong>. When I find a problem, I can’t rest until I understand what the dealio is, or even better, if I’ve got a solution for it. </p>
                    <p>I believe that there is always a way to solution for anything, even if that is not what you were originally thinking it would be. Here’s to hoping that helps with the coding and then eventually leads me down a very exciting and very technical path. Coding has been one of my bucket list items for the past few years, and I’m so excited to finally be learning!</p>
                    <br>
                                      
                    <p>Want to know more? Buried in this site are my answers to these three questions:</p>

                        <li>What was the make and model of my first and only car?</li>
                            <!-- answer accessed from contact.html, click on "Emily", then see surprise.html open in a new tab -->
                        <li>What is my perpetual 12-month plan?</li>
                            <!-- answer accessed from portfolio.html, CTRL + A to select all text, then hover over first image to display text above. -->
                        <li>What church do I attend? </li>
                            <!-- answer accessed from index.html, wait for 10 seconds for the little gray box to appear at the bottom right of page, hover over it, text is disaplyed across the screen. -->
                    </ol>
